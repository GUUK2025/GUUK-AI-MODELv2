# UI Design for Batch Image Cropping Tool

## Design Principles

Based on modern minimalist UI design principles, our batch image cropping tool will follow these key principles:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Focus on essential elements and remove any unnecessary clutter.
2. **Whitespace**: Strategic use of whitespace to create a sense of openness and focus.
3. **Clear Typography**: Use readable fonts with proper hierarchy.
4. **Limited Color Palette**: A minimal color scheme with 2-3 primary colors and accent colors.
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary and secondary elements.
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface works well on different screen sizes.
